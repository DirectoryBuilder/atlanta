<b>Entrance Overlooking Park</b> - Elephant hut in hillside below new green space:<br>

The concept above includes a "Grand Entrance Porch" added to the side of the Cyclorama overlooking the lake.<br><br>

The area under the green space on the south side of the deck could be an expanded zoo facility.  (20 feet of dirt is being added over 1/3 of the current parking lot.)  The zoo could tuck the elephant hut into the side of this new hillside, and use a portion of the green space to expand the elephant exhibit. (A significant amount of new exhibit space and storage could reside under the rest of the green space.)<br><br>

This adjustment would allow the white fence line to be moved below, incorporating the park into a grand zoo entrance. The lower level of the Cyclorama could have a gift store, with the upper level aligning with the top of a plaza over west side parking and educational facilities.<br><br>

The back of the elephant hut could then be underground and the top could be a green surface, for energy cost saving.<br><br>

The lower level of the Cyclorama is currently designated as zoo offices. The offices could instead reside under an elevated terrace on the west side of the Cyclorama to better integrate with the column porch on the top level off the Cyclorama.<br><br>

Zoo office under a terrace will allow for large windows facing the park in a new green space near Cherokee. We could have a big classroom area and media library for field trips.<br><br>

In light of the opportunity created by the elevated green space by the east parking deck, we might have an opportunity to look at shifting the elephant exhibit to utilize the Cyclorama as part of a grand entrance to the zoo that incorporates existing tress in the park.<br><br>

In the current Cyclorama reception hall plans there is not a window facing the lake.  By adding a grand porch we'll have a space for <a href="http://gpna.org">the mothball</a> that also embraces the park.<br><br>

<!--
The current city plans show the entrance by Fort Walker eliminated, and 20 feet of fill dirt added to the green space so the turn-around loop from Ormewood is level with the upper parking level. This creates the need for a large void for ventilation. In contrast, the ventilation <a href="#patio" style="white-space: nowrap">could be covered with a patio</a>.<br><br>
