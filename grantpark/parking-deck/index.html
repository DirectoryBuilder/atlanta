		<h2>Concept 3: Approved by City - Bike Path Connectivity Replaced with Stairway and Elevator</h2>
		In June of 2017 the Urban Design Commission expressed their connectivity concerns, stating “Near the Confederate Drive entrance, it seems like a pedestrian would have to go through some part of the parking garage (using an elevator or stairs, for instance) to get down to the path that would take you to the Zoo Atlanta entrance.”<br><br>

	View the <a href="https://grantpark.wixsite.com/neighborhood">Design Challenges</a> with the design 
ultimately approved by the city.<br><br>

	The design from April 2017 depicts a large stairway on the north side of the proposed deck.  
	A pedestrian "fly-over" bridge connects to the surface of the deck. Traffic from Confederate Ave goes down three levels through a tunnel to the lower level of the deck. 
	The stairway and tunnel below would block east-west bike access to the park from Confederate Ave. 
	The stairway would also prevent bikes and strollers from connecting to the upper level of the deck without crossing at the busy entrance corner of Boulevard and Confederate.<br><br>

	Twenty-one healthy trees would be cut down on Boulevard to add a wider sidewalk. 
	Eight large trees would be removed at the Summer Shade Festival main performance seating area to make way for the large stairway.
	<!--
	Five to eight additional trees would be removed on the Fort Walker side of the deck to allow for cars to access the upper level, whereas grading could be avoided by connecting the south entrance to the lower and middle levels of the deck. 
-->
	Dozens of trees would be removed to provide space for temporary dirt strorage on the north side of the deck. 

	<!--
	All this changes if the vehicle traffic flow connects to the upper level from Confederate Ave and/or uses a single level corkscrew to go to the lower level with a longer space for vehicles to queue off of Boulevard.
	-->
	<br><br>

	A revision made to connect Ormewood (based on a traffic study presented at the start of 2017) altered the outcome of the RFP. The resulting plan blocked bike and stroller paths and removed trees in the bowl.<br><br>

A bandstand on top of the parking deck would have the capacity to entertain 7,000+ seated attendees. The adjacent "Bowl" performance space would have been graded following dirt storage. A stairway and exposed tunnel garage openings would have been added facing Boulevard and the lake. Bike connectivity to Grant Park would have been blocked and strollers would have been unable to access the park from Confederate Avenue without using an elevator.<br><br>

<h2>Concept 4: Bike Friendly, Removes North Stairway to Preserve Trees</h2>


The latest plan below, from September 19, 2017, places the restaurant at the southeast corner of the deck.  

Bridges (indicated in blue) could be added to improve connectivity.

A small set of stairs on the Fort Walker side prevents bikes and strollers from accessing the green space without going up to Boulevard. A square platform south of the restaurant might already be intended for connecting a bridge.  The ideal would be to connect a path over the top to the southwest corner for runners and strollers.

<h2>Concept 5: Connecting Confederate Avenue to upper level of deck</h2>

We have an opportunity to create a linear park space (simlar to Ponce De Leon as one travels toward Decatur).  The new zoo entrance could face a continuous green space with a pathway in the park that continues to Fort Walker.

Traffic could connect to the upper level of the deck from Confederate.  The existing entrance by Fort Walker could connect to the lower level of the deck.

 <b>Flipping the traffic flow</b> - By flipping the deck traffic flow to enter the upper deck level from Confederate, this plan preserves all 24 large hardwood trees around the deck, plus 18 smaller trees at the northwest corner by the Bowl entertainment venue. Deck traffic could be hidden from the park under the base of a pavilion on a large hollow cylinder at the Confederate entrance. Traffic could optionally continue to the lower level after a one-level twist.<br>

By avoiding a fly-over bridge, the deck could be 3 feet lower on the north side to integrate with the park while reducing fill dirt over tree roots along Boulevard.  The planned deck is alreay low enough on the south side. Avoiding terracing in southeast corner of the grassy field would reduce the fill dirt to 3 feet. An 8 to 12 foot wide plank walkway (and bocce ball court) could reside over a hollow storage space on the east side of the deck to further protect the tree roots.  Storage could be accessed from the top level of parking.<br><br>

Residents are requesting a variance to the Beltline overlay which would require replacing large trees on Boulevard with a wide sidewalk. All new construction within one mile of the Beltline requires a wide sidewalk next to the street unless the city grants a variance.

<h2>Connected Green Space on Fort Walker Side of Deck</h2>

	<b>Tree Preservation, Improved Bike Connectivity</b><br>

	<p>According to the city arborist, the position of the deck is not the main issue for the trees on Boulevard, it's the amount of dirt that would need to be placed on their roots to achieve the prior goal of creating a completely flat surface between Boulevard and the grassy deck surface.  By avoiding terrace-steps on the north end, the deck will be several feet lower than Boulevard which will blend with the slope of the surrounding park. Retaining the top 2 feet of the exiting slope on the north side is preferable to a fence along the edge of the park.</p>

	<!--
	<p>
		The trees would be okay with up to 3 feet of dirt added, but almost 6 feet of dirt was previously planned for the deck to be flush with Boulevard and the terraces in the grass at the south end. 
		The east side nail wall position would also damage tree roots, so we've requested moving the deck wall further from Boulevard.
		<a href="https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20992774_2364358443788774_1316031920008323392_n.jpg?oh=d420e640957613a8715f913ef4acbe09&oe=5A3B6D02" target="btrees">View looking south</a></p>
	-->

		<!-- 
			There's a lot of wiggle room to design a solution that preserves trees along Boulevard, while keeping them healthy with better irrigation. 
		-->

	<!--
	<p>We can avoid a recessed "ditch" area at the southeast corner by placing plank decking over the tree roots. 
	Bocce ball courts could reside under the trees by adding a layer of sand over cement plank decking.</p>
	-->

	<p>We can accommodate the requirement of the Beltline Overlay to create a wide pathway by locating the main path away from the street, over the top of the deck, as already planned by the architects (minus the stairway). The wide pathway could match the width of the path that continues through Fort Walker. A “Beltline Administrative Variation” can be issued by the Atlanta City Zoning department so we don't end up with two wide pathways running parallel. The city granted Topgolf Atlanta an exception to preserve their trees.</p>

	<p>Altering the entire length of Boulevard within one mile from the Beltline to accommodate a wide Beltline-style path directly on the edge of Boulevard is far from realistic. The steep hillside on the edge of Fort Walker makes this impossible, plus we have a steep downward slope above the bowl entertainment venue. Craftsman style houses with a standard sidewalk and small front yards (without room for further reduction) reside further north. 

	The contiguous solution would be for the wide pathway to reside within the park. Fortunately the deck planners have already included a wide pathway immediately to the west of the existing trees.</p>

	<!--
	<p>Note that none of the trees on Boulevard were effected by hurricane Irma, so the argument that they are unhealthy due to drought and roadside carbon was not supported.</p>
	-->

	<!--
	<p>In addition to preserving approximately 12 of the 14 trees on Boulevard, Flipping the Deck would retain 8 large trees at the bowl (a popular stage at the Summer "Shade" Festival) by avoiding adding a large stairway. 
	
	Five to eight more large trees could be retained on the side facing Fort Walker by avoiding grading the retained parking area, since traffic would then enter the lower level from the south.

		<b>Advantages of connecting to top parking level from Confederate Ave:</b><br><br>

		A. Provides a direct path for bikes, strollers and wheelchairs to access the deck's green surface. without crossing near Boulevard and Confederate Ave.<br>
	B. Provides room for traffic calming around a north-south crossing where strollers will have more visibility than the corner of Confederate and Boulevard.<br>
	C. Provides wheelchair and stroller access to all four deck elevations directly from park.<br>
	D. Moves ground level deck entrance to south side, so fewer turning cars will block the Confederate Ave intersection. Most drivers will then use the Ormewood Ave entrance to walk directly into Zoo Atlanta lower level parking.<br>
	E. Further reduces turning delays by reducing north-south pedestrian, stroller and bike crossings at Boulevard corner, which has a wall blocking visibility.<br>
	F. Avoids a tunnel and a barrier that prevents bikes from entering the park directly at Confederate Ave.<br>
	G. Eliminates grading on the Fort Walker side of the deck, thereby preserving five large trees.<br>
	H. Avoids a dangerous drop from the edge of a fly-over bridge to the bottom of a tunnel.<br>
	I. Uses terraces to conceal the deck. Creates additional openings for airflow.<br>

<h2>Agreement Reached with City</h2>

	<b>On October 9, 2017</b><br>
	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed authorized his administration to work with Grant Park community members to create a plan that preserves trees and improves connectivity.<br><br>

	<b>On December 21, 2017</b><br>
	The city and Save the Trees of Grant Park legal team reached the following agreement:<br><br>

	<div style="font-size:15px">
	1) The City agrees to preserve 10 additional Grant Park trees. Five are in the bowl, five are down by the pond.<br><br>

	2) The City agrees NOT to stockpile dirt in the bowl during construction. This will minimize damage to the surrounding trees and the 4 specimen trees which are to be preserved in the middle of the bowl.<br><br>

	3) The City agrees to attempt to save #2745, the large water oak on the corner of Boulevard and United. The City also agrees to attempt to save #2731, the 100 year old white oak in the southern end of the Boulevard lot.
	<br><br>

	4) The City agrees to redesign the flyover bridge to make it ADA compliant and to make it friendly for use by cyclists. There will be future design meetings about this.<br><br>

	5) The City agrees to turn the southern end of the current Boulevard lot into greenspace. They will cover the remaining asphalt with dirt and greenery. (Ripping out the asphalt would likely damage the roots of the remaining trees, more than leaving it in). This area will not be a bus parking lot.<br><br>

	6) The bandstand on top of the deck will be redesigned as a pavilion. There will be future design meetings about this.<br><br>

	<a href="https://www.savethetreesgp.org/donate">Please consider donating</a> to show your appreciation and help the Save the Trees of Grant Park legal team break even.<br>
	The cost of city record searches and legal fees exceeded $7,000, with a large portion contributed by residents on Boulevard.<br><br>


	<b>On April 24, 2018</b><br>
	The city cut down the large water oak on the corner of Boulevard and United Avenue (tree #2745).<br><br>

	<b>2020</b><br>
	A winding path was added at Boulevard and United Avenue to enter the park adjacent to the stairway.<br>
	Taking a stroller from United Avenue into the park would no longer require using an elevator!<br><br>

	<h1>What's next?</h1>

	The city will conduct design meetings about the pavilion and green space. 
	Ideas for further exploration:<br><br>

	A.) The restaurant could be re-positioned to be adjacent to the zoo, as both the main entrance and a transit stop, to provide an open view of greenspace along Boulevard.<br><br>

	B.) The Ormewood entrance loop could reside under the zoo entrance restaurant, for passenger loading. Elevating the west side of the greenspace would eliminate the embankment on the south side of the deck.<br><br>
	
	C.) Extending proposed Georgia Ave lightrail to deck could provide easier access to Ormewood residents.<br><br>
	D.) Hiding the south side of the deck by rasing the greenspace ground level on west side when pivoting the entrance restaurant location.  Both upper and lower traffic loop area under entrance building could have open views of the zoo entrance walkway planned within the zoo.<br><br>

	E.) Reopening pathway to Atlanta Avenue as safer neighborhood route to Beltline than narrow sidewalk on Boulevard. The pathway would avoid the significant slope up Fort Walker. The wide width allows for pedestrian and bike separation. Ideal for the new influx of shared vehicles.<br><br>

	F.) Grant Park History Center within zoo backlot adjacent to Fort Walker.<br><br>

	G.) Zoo visitors and transit riders who park on city streets could pay with an online app rather than parking meters.<br><br>

	H.) Residents could help the city place parking tickets on non-resident vehicles, with funds allocated to local shuttles.<br><br>

Prior version: The restaurant could be repostioned to be part of the zoo entrance over a bus parking area with connected green space.<br><br>


<a href="img/surface-green.jpg"><img class="hidePrint" src="img/surface-green.jpg" style="width:100%"></a><br><br>


By moving the restaurant, the Boulevard streetscape views would remain unobstructed.

Ormewood could connect back to Boulevard using the existing south entrance. 
One flight of stairs could be added to hide the southwest corner of the deck.<br><br>

If flipping the deck is also included (<a href="#concept4">concept 4</a>), the north side of the deck could have terraced seating overlooking the stage while hiding the side of the deck. A co-work space shared with police and park volunteers could reside in the upper level of the deck overlooking the stage.<br><br>

	Visitors using on-street parking could enter their license plate number and pay by the hour, similar to Ponce City Market in Atlanta.<br><br>

	Revenue would go toward burying powerlines, which is estimated at one million dollars per mile.<br><br>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

46 feet was the shortest distance to hard drilling (49 to 51 feet from deck surface).  The deck could have been 4 levels deep without hitting bedrock. Only 3 levels were built. 
Closest distance to groundwater was about 12 feet from the bottom of the deck at B-3 
(which is 44 feet from the previous asphalt surface, and 46 to 49 feet from the top of the deck).<br><br>

<!--
Recommending lowering north end by 3 to 4 feet for pathway slope. No rock drilling will be required based on the findings above and no ground water will be reached based on levels at time of drilling.<br>
-->

	<!--
		Groundwater at time of drilling is below the deck level at all points. Seems to be about 8 to 10 feet below the bottom of the deck at B-3, and 18 feet below the bottom of the deck at B-2. (Rough estimates are based on a deck 3 feet lower deck, I'll get more precise 

46 feet is the shortest distance to hard drilling. The 46 foot measurement (at B-3) is taken from the upper asphalt, so there's about 49 feet from top of the deck to the closest hard drilling when the deck top is at the preferred level for the tree roots, visual appeal and child safety - about 3 feet lower than Boulevard.
