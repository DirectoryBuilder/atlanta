<div style="margin:30px">
<b>Entry Twist</b> - Confederate Avenue could go down one level and continue into a hidden parking area with 30 additional spaces<!--, where the tunnel reside in the current city plans-->.<br><br>

- Provides 584 feet for vehicles to line up off of Boulevard. Current city plan provides 320 feet.<br>
- Provides vehicle access to both the lower and upper deck levels from Confederate Ave.<br>
- Creates pathways for bikes and runners both east-west and north-south. Eliminates stairway.<br>
- Better Security: allows vehicle entrance to be closed with a pivoting door at night.<br>
- Preserves all the trees at the bowl. Prevents headlights from shining into park.<br>
