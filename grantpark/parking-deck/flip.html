		Tree Preservation - Connected Pathways
	</div>

	<p>As residents reviewed plans for tree removal and new tree planting with the City of Atlanta arborist and Grant Park Conservancy members, an alternative traffic flow emerged. Refered to as "Flipping the Deck," it offers the following advantages without reducing parking spaces:<br><br>

	- Provides pathways to all four levels of the deck for bike, wheelchair and stroller access<br>
	- Connects bike routes through the park in both east-west and north-south directions<br>
	- Separate bikeways/walkways from traffic crossings on both sides of deck<br>
	- Eliminates the need to grade the Fort Walker side of the deck where five large trees reside<br>
	- Avoids storing dirt in the park to preserve additional trees<br>
	- Optionally uses a cylinder platform with a pavilion to conceal traffic entering from Confederate Avenue

<p>Locating the elevated music area at the southeast corner could provide a deck to protects the tree roots from excess dirt. Music would thereby point away from houses and the zoo toward the park pool. A railing behind the stage 	could add a barrier to protect children from busy Boulevard. A short 2 foot wall to the north could provide a natural barrier.</p>

	This revision is made possible by connecting Confederate Ave to the upper level of the deck, rather than desending three levels through a tunnel. The majority of Zoo Atlanta traffic would use the south entrance if it connects to ground level, thereby reducing traffic congestion at Confederate. By locating the wide pathway within the park, away from Boulevard, traffic congestion will be further reduced by eliminating waiting at the corner for pedestrians and bikes.  Bikes and strollers will have a direct route to the upper deck surface with enough distance from Boulevard for cars to turn in and wait without blocking traffic. By avoiding a large stariway, wheelchairs would have direct access to the top of the deck, plus all three parking levels through terraced pathways that conceal the deck, as depicted above.</p>

<b>Child-friendly:</b><br>

- Creates north-south pathway for strollers to access the green roof.<br>
- Creates east-west pathways for joggers and cyclists to travel to the lake from Confederate Avenue.<br>
- Separates vehicle traffic from cross-walk at Ormewood which will have a light for children biking to school.<br>
- Eliminates 3 story falls from side of deck.<br>
