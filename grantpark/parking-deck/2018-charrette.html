1. Graceful path from Fort Walker to Ormewood crossing. Avoid right angle turns in Beltline route. No three step stairway.<br><br>

3. Covered MARTA bus stop on Atlanta Ave and Park Ave with trash bin, solar roof (no visible side panels), shared bike dock (not just Uber Jump-Relay Bikes).<br><br>
4. Plant wall on south face of deck and restaurant. Edible plants (Living Building Challenge), piezoelectric mist irrigation test site for Georgia Tech research.<br><br>
