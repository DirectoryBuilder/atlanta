# Cherokee Bike Routes

Here's a concept for Cherokee Ave bike routes that restores the designated southbound bike lane in the street based on the recommendation of Andy Levitz and others. It includes bushes around a low fence as a child barrier. The people walking on the left side occupy the current sidewalk, with a new row of trees planted where the edge of the pavement currently resides. Elevating the bike path to be even with the sidewalk makes it very clear that cars are not welcome.
