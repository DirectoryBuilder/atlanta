Please include access for smart shuttle on the streetcar route of the Atlanta Beltline carrying 6 to 12 passengers, similar to the shuttles being tested on North Avenue. Two smaller shuttles can pass within the space of a larger transit vehicle lane to allow for greater flexibility during door-to-door transit.

Integrating with a network of shuttles could compete effectively with Uber and Lyft to increase city transit revenue. Shuttles can take riders door-to-door as they connect using neighborhood side streets and designated greenway trails. 6 to 12 person shuttles are also the ideal size for future integration with high speed underground transit.

May Mobility shuttles are one example of a narrow shuttle vehicle that would allow for passing within the width of a single light rail track. Safety drivers at the front of the May Mobility shuttle can stop the vehicle at any time. All shuttle riders could be provided with an emergency stop button.

Here's a link to learn more about May Mobility shuttles financed by Toyota and BMW. May Mobility shuttles are already in use in Detroit and Ann Arbor.

Similar Transdev autonomous vehicles have been tested on North Avenue:

With 3 to 6 doors on each side of the shuttle vehicles, passengers enter and exit without disrupting other riders. Handicapped individuals don't have to navigate down an isle.

Let's provide a separate path for bikes and scooters so people and dogs are not at risk of injury. The existing Beltline walkway would be unchanged. Transit vehicles could travel over a paved surface with geo-fence guides. A planted median with a decorative wooden fence could separate pedestrians from vehicle lanes.

The Beltline resides in the perfect location for efficient last-mile shuttle service directly to homes and retail. If the Beltline is only a rail route, the stops will be spread out and many riders will still need to use Uber/Lyft to complete their commute. Fewer stops increase the property value of high density construction directly at stops, it's not an engine for development and destinations along the entire route.

In contrast, innovative shuttle services have the potential to create vibrant street communities with independent operators and in-vehicle services along the entire Beltline route akin to the Toyota e-Pallette vehicle.

The City of Miami recently reviewed the trackless trains being developed in China. They found that the technology was not ahead of the shuttle automation systems already implemented for smaller vehicles in the United States.

One has to ask, why do we prefer large transit over small? In situations where vehicles are sharing roads with cars, larger is safer. But when vehicles reside near areas where children are playing and running, as on the Beltline, smaller shuttles that stop quickly are safer. Smaller shuttles also carry riders directly to destinations for safer evening trips, and subsequently more frequent usage.

During off peak hours we could either have 22+ mostly empty trains circling the Beltline to provide pickups every 15 to 30 minutes, or fewer large vehicles and more on-demand shuttles arriving within minutes to take riders directly to their homes.

Large transit can pause at stations and wider sections to allow for shuttles to pass, In smart transit networks, vehicles communicate with each other, forming trains to minimize interruptions to the tranquility of the space. A 2 foot grass median could reside between the transit route and the bike path, to allow for emergency passing outside of wider areas if a transit vehicle breaks down.

Many light rail projects are vitally important to solving traffic congestion, including the extension of the Auburn/Edgewood street car to Krog Street Market without overhead wires. The existing cars could be sold to another city as we switch to electric batteries throughout the city. We need a vocal advocacy for transit routes that do not share lanes with with car traffic. The designation of appropriate neighborhood streets as bike, shuttle and resident-only routes is an excellent way to keep our transit moving smoothly and significantly faster than cars during rush hour.

Ultimately the Beltline has the potential to be the world's coolest and safest last-mile feeder network by providing door-to-door access via shuttles and seamless connections (often without transfers) to smart transit arteries into the heart of Atlanta's business districts (like the shuttles planned for North Avenue). Let's retain the incredible people-focused, recreation space that the Beltline currently provides while safely separating bikes and scooters from people, large transit and potential shuttle services facing the walkway side.
