Hi Matt, I'm interested in adding to your Atlanta Cities Skyline project for a Hulsey Yard revitalization project.

I'd like to convey the advantages of moving rail underground from downtown to Decatur now that Hulsey is no longer a freight yard.

Is your Atlanta model available for download?

Hello Elizabeth, was your husband Matt creating a Cities: Skylines model of Atlanta before he passed away? I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech studying urban design and a programmer analyst at the Georgia Department of Economic Development. I can be reached at loren@dreamstudio.com 678-468-1000.  I'm interested in carrying forward Matt's legacy by making his Atlanta model part of a Georgia community planning initiate. Matt's gallery: https://imgur.com/gallery/4IfK7



Hi Matt, I'm interested in adding to your Atlanta Cities Skyline project for a Hulsey Yard revitalization project.  Would you be interested in using GitHub to collaborate?  I'm new to Cities:Skylines.  I have two kids in high school who are into city planning games and I'm studying civil engineering at Georgia Tech.

The game has strong Steam Workshop support, where people (or you!) can design their own churches (like the one above), houses and city halls and everyone else can just drop them into the game
