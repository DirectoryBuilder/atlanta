<h4>Regarding the proposed development at 800 Glenwood Ave...</h4><br>

<!--

-->
<ul style="margin:0px">
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">The <span style="white-space:nowrap">Fuqua application</span> is not transit oriented and does not meet any of the principles or goals of the BeltLine project.

<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">The development is all commercial retail with no residential component. The project should include a mixed-use component to support future transit - especially in an area where a station will be located.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Large parking lots for over 1,000 cars are&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>transit oriented or neighborhood friendly, and certainly not pedestrian friendly environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Any development at this location should comply with the requirements of the BeltLine Zoning Overlay and the Sub-Area 4 Plan which was approved by City Council in 2011.
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">The application does not include plans to show how storm water will be managed at this site. The very large proposed parking lot will create a large volume of rainwater runoff, which could have a significant impact on storm water sewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Millions of taxpayer dollars and many years have been spent on BeltLine planning and design by Atlanta BeltLine Inc. Approval of this application would be a major setback for the BeltLine vision in this area, and would show blatant disregard for approved plans. It would also serve as a good example of the Department of Planning&#39;s waste of taxpayer funds &ndash; which is not something that we want to see.</li>

<h4>As residents advocating smart development...</h4><br>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">

	<div >
		<div>
			<b>1. We want a mix of retail</b>&nbsp;- We want multiple mid-size stores to encourage competition on quality, including a small or medium sized grocery market.</div>
			<div class="app2">Fuqua application has no mid-size retail!</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<b>2. We want density on the Beltline</b>&nbsp;- &nbsp;We embrace multi-story development as defined by the Beltline Master Plan.  Higher density residential guarantees that beltline businesses will thrive.</div>
			<div class="app2">Fuqua application is single-story with no residential!</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>

		<div>
			<b>3. We want localized traffic</b>&nbsp;- We endorse the traffic plan of the Beltline overlay and its emphasis on traffic originating in the local communities.</div>
			<div class="app2">Fuqua application caters to destination shoppers from outside the neighborhood by creating a massive discount store, while blocking out opportunities for a locally focused, mid-size grocery market and outfitter on the beltline. <span style="white-space:nowrap"><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2124677/Walmart-Pathmark-branded-WORST-grocery-chains-U-S-shoppers.html" target="consumer">View Consumer Reports list of the lowest quality grocery stores in the U.S.</a></span></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<b>4. We want well-designed parking</b>&nbsp;- We want onstreet parking, covered parking and smaller surface lots.</div>
			<div class="app2">Fuqua application lacks onstreet parking on east-west roads.  Proposed parking deck needs revisions to create a walkable neighborhood - reduce exposed parking surfaces, hide west edge of parking deck, add enclosed parking deck(s). <a style="white-space:nowrap" href="http://neighborhood.org/glenwood/beltline/concepts/parking/">View covered parking example</a> as contrasted with

		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>

			<div>
			<b>5. We want retail windows</b> - Let in the light with street-facing windows. Avoid the false facades used at Edgewood.</div>

			<div class="app2">Fuqua application fails to provide street-facing windows on anchor store.  Use of small stores to "cheat the system" is not acceptable.  The proposed parking deck's southeast corner also has no street frontage.</div>

		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>


			<div>
				<b>6. We desire collaboration</b>&nbsp;- 

				We are interested in bringing the input of the community to the table.
				<!--
				Our unified planning can be a model for other developers working with neighborhoods.
				-->

				<div class="app2">Fuqua application failed to incorporate input from the community.</div>
				</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>

		<div>
			<b>7. We want safe neighborhoods</b>&nbsp;- Include abundant &quot;eyes on the street&quot; viewpoints from homes and storefronts at ground level to discourage theft.</div>

			<div class="app2">Fuqua application fails to create a self-policing neighborhood by omitting homes.  The city will need to hire extra police to patrol the area after business hours.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>

			<!--
		<div>
			<b>We request a traffic study</b> - Understanding where local consumers shop will help us plan and develop appropriately.</div>

	</div>
	
	<!--
		<b>We want input from all parties</b> - We want an achievable budget, with expansion when the economy justifies additions.</div>
<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		-->

<div><b>8. We want residential and offices</b> - Include multi-story residential, live/work above shops and office space.</div>

<div class="app2">Fuqua application fails to provide any residential or office space.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<b>9. We want areas for children</b> - Avoid placing a heavy traffic route and a busy intersection next to the beltline trail! Include a <a href="http://neighborhood.org/glenwood/beltline/concepts/parking/">centrally located playground</a> within the Glenwood Place development.


</div>

<div class="app2">Fuqua application provides no areas for children.   Heavy traffic routes intersect the beltline trail in three locations.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<b>10. We want more on-street parking </b> - 

Avoid a massive central parking lot.  Use a street grid and include covered parking. 

<div class="app2">Fuqua application has no onstreet parking on the two east-west roads.  Covered parking has not been designed to create a walkable neighborhood.</div>

<!--

</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
	
	<div>
		<b>11. We want mid-size retail rather than a megastore</b> - Encourage competition on quality with a mix of 
		mid-size stores rather than tiny surrounding stores.</div>

		<div class="app2">Fuqua application has a only one large store.  Surrounding stores are too small to provide space for competition on quality.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>
		<b>12. We want stores that match our local demographics</b> - We're concerned local residents will continue to have to drive across town for quality.</div>

		<div class="app2">Fuqua application fails to provide a store layout that would suit the list of desired stores provided by our local reps to Fuqua Development.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

	<div>
		<b>13. We want water retention and reuse</b> - Recycle water for irrigation. Avoid over taxing the city's water treatment facility.</div>

		<div class="app2">Fuqua application has little or no water retention.  There is no evidence of water recycling for irrigation.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<b>14. We want smart street lighting</b> - Reduce overhead lights to keep the night sky dark. Include covered parking.</div>
		
		<div class="app2">Fuqua application does not cover the upper level of parking.  Excessive uncovered lots are a major departure from the design of the beltline focus group.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>
		<a href="http://www.rand.org/news/press/2013/03/05.html">This RAND Land-Use Zoning Study in Los Angeles</a> found that single-use commercially zoned blocks in Los Angeles have crime rates that are 45 percent higher than similar blocks that include residential uses.<br><br>

		View a local resident's concept for <a href="http://neighborhood.org/glenwood/beltline/concepts/parking/">covered parking below a walkable main street</a> which extends the parking structure from Fuqua's second application, adds residential and eliminates the canyon in front of the anchor store.<br>

<!--
Save the Beltline refers to holding the city accountable for enforcing the beltline master plan. The decisions the city makes regarding the 800 Glenwood property will set precedent for whether similar sprawling developments ignore years of zoning developed by the city and the local NPUs. The mayor is currently in the process of hiring a new beltline director. This is basically a case of a developer trying to make a quick buck by building only one-story, minimum cost construction adjacent to a future rail route that Atlanta tax payers will have spent millions to create. It's important to note that the developer does not own the property. Fuqua has an option to buy it from Lafarge Cement.

The Fuqua business model is to start by going after low hanging fruit, to see where they can find the least objection to building cheap stores. By encouraging the city to stay firm and bring quality construction to 800 Glenwood, we'll guarantee that surrounding real estate values will generate higher tax revenues for the city. The right combination of retail, residential and offices at 800 Glenwood will be a boon for residential construction along the beltline. A snarled mess of traffic and a massive uncovered parking lot will not. A smart approach would be to build a quality retail portion now (grocery store, theater, outfitter), then add residential density later as the home buying market completes its turn around.
